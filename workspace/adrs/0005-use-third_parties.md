Date: 2025-10-13

Accepted

## Context

Developing these systems in-house would be resource-intensive. Leveraging third-party services can save time and provide specialized functionality.

## Decision

* **Negative**: Dependency on external vendors; limitations based on the capabilities and constraints of the third-party systems.
